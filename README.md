# Advent of code helper

Tools I use for completing Advent of Code in Swift.

These are originally pulled out of https://github.com/Brent-Tunnicliff/advent_of_code_2023, but have then been expanded.

Since I am low on time, decided to do Advent of Code in Swift again since I am most familiar with it.
Last year I did Advent of Code for the first time and created some helper classes that I kept reusing and iterating upon.
Decided to pull them into here so can keep using them again.

# Disclaimer

None of these are designed for production code, and many are probably not greatly designed.
These are made to quickly just get answers for the Advent of Code.
